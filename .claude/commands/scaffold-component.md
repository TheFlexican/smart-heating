description: Scaffold a new Home Assistant component following smart_heating patterns and conventions
---

Use the ha-scaffolder agent to create a new component. Generate:
- Component file with proper structure (coordinator, entity, API handler, etc.)
- All necessary imports and type hints
- Docstrings in Google style
- Following smart_heating naming conventions
- Basic test file structure
- TODO comments for user implementation

Follow project file organization and architectural patterns exactly.
