### Fixed
- Preserve zones overview viewport when updating an area's temperature; avoid large list loader during small updates to prevent scrolling/jumps. (frontend)
- Area cards are no longer clickable; area configuration is now accessible from the area card's three-dots menu (ensures a consistent way to reach settings).
